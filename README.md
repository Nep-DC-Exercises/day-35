# Express, ES6 Templates

## Date: 10/16/19 W8 D3 D35

### Summary

We reviewed arrow function syntax and learned some of the benefits of using this ES6 feature. The `arrowfx.js` file contains code from an in-class review of arrow functions. My main takeaway is that it makes functions more readable and concise, the implicit one line return is great, and the way `this` isn't rebound in a class method is useful.

In this repo, the `expressapi` folder was a "code-along" assignment as we learned how to utilize Express. The `express_proj` was work I completed as part of an assignment to get more practice with using express.
